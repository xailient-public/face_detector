# Introduction

## Xailient Face Detector SDK

Xailient Face Detector SDK is the world's fastest face detector. It makes real-time face detection possible.

Xailient Face Detector SDK is especially designed and optimized for computationally limited devices such as embedded devices. For example, Xailient Face Detector SDK can even run on a Raspberry Pi Zero.

Its compact size and efficient algorithm makes it suitable for real-time applications.

## Who is it designed for?

1. Xailient Face Detector SDK is for you if you are developing an application for embedded devices and are facing challenges running face detection algorithms on it.

2. Xailient Face Detector SDK is for you if you are creating an application that builds on top of face detector and you want to get the best face detector that available (without reinventing the wheel), and send more time working on the business logic of your application, so that you can deliver to your customers faster.

3. Xailient Face Detector SDK is for you of your application has real-time needs.

4. Xailient Face Detector SDK is for you if you are a hobbyist who likes doing DIY projects, creating cool stuffs that requires face detection, such as DIY home surveillance.

## Why Xailient Face Detector SDK?

1. Xailient Face Detector SDK is compact and has a very small memory footprint (45kb).

2. It is designed for computationally limited embedded devices such as RaspberryPi and runs efficiently on these devices as well.

3. It is fast and is suutable for use in real-time applications.

4. It is easy to download and use.
